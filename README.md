### About
A quick little app I built while at home for christmas when my Father-in-law wanted
to track his wife's migraines in relation to the barometric pressure and a few other factors.

The app is built for mobile and was really only styled for mobile.

### Tech
<ul>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>React Router</li>
    <li>LocalStorage</li>
    <li>Moment JS</li>
    <li>Recharts (graphing)</li>
    <li>Jest and Enzyme</li>
</ul>

### Notes
Next time I would use Redux, I didn't think I would have this much state management when I first talked about the project.

The tests for this are overkill but I was just playing with a few things.
